# Marda Science

We are a tiny science consultancy. We consist of Dr Daniel Buscombe and Dr Maria Campbell. Our [website](https://www.mardascience.com) is still under development but details some of the work that we do. This is the landing page for Dan's page of software repositories and datasets that concern projects in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Remote Sensing, Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Geospatial analysis. It gives a more complete picture. Dan often [tweets](https://twitter.com/magic_walnut) about the status of various projects and how to use his software tools. Some teaching resources are hosted through our [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/mardascience).

Dan's other github handle is [dbuscombe-usgs](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs). He develop codes collaboratively and host them mostly in a range of Github organizations, listed below:

## Active Software Projects

### Doodleverse

> Deep-learning based semantic segmentation of geospatial data. 

In the past two years I led the development and now maintain a set of TensorFlow-based tools specifically designed for this task - from developing training data to creating deployment ready models. The set of tools is available on [Github Doodleverse Org.](https://github.com/Doodleverse). I have recently [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I1TOOGfdZ0)about these tools and how they are being [applied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnmotT2hDn0) in production. 

That work has spawned the development of several downstream applications for specific tasks. For example, I oversee a small team developing satellite-image based shoreline [mapping tools](https://github.com/SatelliteShorelines/CoastSeg) as we work towards a prospectus outlined in a [recent paper](https://doi.org/10.31223/X54P9Z). Another generic toolbox for semantic segmentation of geospatial imagery called [Seg2Map](https://github.com/Doodleverse/seg2map) is in the works.

### SediNet

> Deep-learning based estimation of sediment grain size

Several of my model frameworks, including [SediNet](https://github.com/DigitalGrainSize/SediNet), combine to amass a citizen science database of beach sand measurements for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, called the [SandSnap project](https://sandsnap-erdcchl.hub.arcgis.com/). SediNet is software for application of deep convolutional neural networks to estimation of quantitative and qualitative properties of sediment in photographic imagery. 

Other (older) software for automated analyses of grain size from images of sediment usign wavelets is also [available](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/pyDGS) and widely used, having amassed several hundred academic paper [citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bwVl0NwAAAAJ&hl=en).

### OWG

>Deep-learning based estimation of nearshore ocean wave properties

I research methods to measure surf zone waves from satellite imagery by adapting a [deep learning model framework](https://github.com/OpticalWaveGauging/OpticalWaveGauging_DNN) I developed to larger scales.

Software for application of deep convolutional neural networks to estimation of ocean wave properties from time-series of imagery are available in the [Github Optical Wave Gauging Org.](https://github.com/OpticalWaveGauging)

### Ping-mapper

> Sidescan sonar processing and analysis

I have been involved in sidescan sonar processing for a decade. I oversee a software project for reading, processing and analysis of Humminbird sidescan data, called [Ping-mapper]https://github.com/CameronBodine/PINGMapper/). It is based on older software I wrote for for reading, processing and analysis of Humminbird sidescan data. Source code available in Python/Cython [here](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum) is now archived, having been succeeded by PING-Mapper.

### RetinaDamage

> Deep Learning for estimating damage to buildings due to natural disasters

This project trained a [RetinaNet model](https://github.com/CoastalBuildings/HurricaneHarvey_buildingdamage) to detect building damage in Maxar satellite imagery.

### GobyNet

> Deep-learning based detection of benthic fish

I have written software for automated detection of camouflaged benthic fish using models based on RetinaNet and deep residual U-Net. Source code currently available in Python (link soon).

### RegionalGrainSizeModel

> Machine Learning for estimating beach grain size over regional scales

This ongoing project uses [boosted regression trees](https://github.com/C-GRASP/RegionalGrainSizeModel) to estimate sand beach grain size over regional scales from a suite of covariates like beach slope, tide, and wave climate.

### prism

> Multibeam processing and analysis

Software for probabilistic seafloor habitat mapping using multibeam backscatter. Code [here](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/prism)

### PBR-filter
Novel {P}ansharpening by {B}ackground {R}emoval algorithm for sharpening RGB images. Code [here](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/PBR_filter)

### pysesa

Software for spatially explicit analyis of point clouds and spatially distributed data. Code (now archived) is [here](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/pysesa).


## Teaching materials

I have taught several classes on Machine Learning and data science principles, including development and teaching of Machine Learning courses for my coworkers and the wider geoscience community. 

### ML-Mondays
Teaching materials and software for application of deep convolutional neural networks for analysis of photographic imagery. Supervised and semi-supervised deep learning models and data for image segmentation, and object detection. Source code currently available in Python on the [ML-Mondays Github Org.](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/MLMONDAYS)

### Image Segmentation with UNets

* Check out my ["LearnImageSegmentationWithUnets" Github Org.](https://github.com/LearnImageSegmentationWithUnets)! This links with two online courses hosted using GitLab
    * [Binary image_segmentation for geosciences](https://mardascience.gitlab.io/binary_image_segmentation_for_geosciences/#/), hosted from this [gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/mardascience/binary_image_segmentation_for_geosciences)
    * [Deep learning for landscape classification](https://mardascience.gitlab.io/deep_learning_landscape_classification/#/), hosted from this [gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/mardascience/deep_learning_landscape_classification)

* I wrote an online course for [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/monitoring-changes-in-surface-water-using-satellite-image-data) for detection of lakes from Sentinel-2 imagery using deep learning.
